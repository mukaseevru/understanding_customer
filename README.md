School 21 (Ecole 42) project

This project is an introduction to deep learning and NLP: recurrent neural nets (RNN), LSTM, Transformer, BERT, CNN

The goal of this project is to give you a first approach to Deep Learning algorithms applied to NLP tasks. You will try to preprocess text data and train different architectures for intent classification: RNN, LSTM, BERT.
